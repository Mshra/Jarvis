## Why?
The Large Language Models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude...and many more are one of the best frontiers in the field of Machine Learning and AI. The text generation of a query propt through Natural Language Processing is one of primary features of these LLM's.

- Why not harness these feature to my own site? <br>
- Why should we be limited to the interface provided by the companies for text generation? <br>
- Why should we not make our own project more powerful and harness of this technology?

These questions are answered by Jarvis
