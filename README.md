# Jarvis

Large Language Models or LLM’s are at the forefront of the AI today or tech in general. With every big tech giant and AI labs in race for AGI they are being utilised and integrated in every facet of our lifestyle.

But there is a limitation, the interaction through these LLM’s are limited. The common option is to use the interface provided. This is limiting for common users and for developers who make their own from scratch and perform API calls. Hence, it is complex to harness these power of llms in our project.

This is why I present Jarvis. It is a search bar component which you can integrate in your own node project and allow text generation through prompts.
Integrate the power of LLM's in your site.

Install it using
```console
npm i @tarzi/jarvis
```
and import it by
```javascript
import { SearchBar } from "@tarzi/jarvis"
```

You are ready to go!

## Why?
The Large Language Models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude...and many more are one of the best frontiers in the field of Machine Learning and AI. The text generation of a query propt through Natural Language Processing is one of primary features of these LLM's.

- Why not harness these feature to your own site? <br>
- Why should we be limited to the interface provided by the LLM's for text generation? <br>

These questions are answered by Jarvis!
